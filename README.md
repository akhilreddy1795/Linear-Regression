# Linear-Regression
IN this we have performed linear regression over a bike sharing data to estimate the demand varying with different features.
In this project we have performed regression Analysis on the data provided from a Bike sharing company where the objectice is to identify the important feature for demand forecasting in future reference
performed EDA firstly arranged data as per the categories, performed visualization using seaborn and matplotlib libraries to identify any patterns.
Performed OLS method and concluded results using R2 score note: this can be done quite simpler of not using any trail and error method rather using RFE but we are in learning stage we went in doing every thing from basic.
